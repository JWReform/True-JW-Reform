        <h1>Welcome to True JW Reform</h1>
        <p>A movement for thoughtful Jehovah's Witnesses, aiming for internal reform without rejecting core biblical doctrines.</p>
    </header>

    <!-- About Us Section -->
    <section id="about-us">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a group of Jehovah's Witnesses who aim for a spiritual reform within the movement, keeping the core biblical doctrines while rejecting leadership tactics that mislead and control. Our focus is on spiritual freedom, the true application of Bible teachings, and restoring the early Christian practices of worship.</p>

    <!-- Core Beliefs Section -->
    <section id="core-beliefs">
        <h2>Our Core Beliefs</h2>
        <p>Our beliefs are similar to those of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses, but we emphasize several differences. Here are the main points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No central governing authority:</strong> We believe each congregation should elect its own elders, as the Bible teaches, instead of having a central authority like the Watchtower governing body.</li>
            <li><strong>No invisible presence of Christ in 1919:</strong> We reject the idea that Christ invisibly chose the Governing Body of Watchtower in 1919 as His mouthpiece. Instead, we believe that Jesus will judge His house before Armageddon.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavenly hope only for Christians:</strong> We reject the idea that some Christians have an earthly hope. We believe only those chosen by Jehovah to rule with Christ in heaven are the true Christians.</li>
            <li><strong>Using only Scripture-based materials:</strong> We follow Bible teachings and use materials that align with Scripture, not men's ideas, allowing for independent Bible study.</li>
            <li><strong>144,000 as a symbolic group:</strong> We view the 144,000 mentioned in Revelation as symbolic, representing the faithful Christian Church, not a literal number.</li>
            <li><strong>Freedom of thought:</strong> We believe in the freedom of thought in non-salvation matters, and reject excommunication for expressing differing opinions.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Differences with Watchtower Section -->
    <section id="differences-with-watchtower">
        <h2>Our Differences with Watchtower</h2>
        <p>We are not a splinter group but a movement for internal reform. The following are key areas where we differ from the Watchtower organization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We believe the Church should not have a central authority.</li>
            <li>We reject the 1919 doctrine of Christ invisibly choosing the Governing Body of the Watchtower.</li>
            <li>We believe in the heavenly hope for all Christians, not the "earthly hope" for some.</li>
            <li>We value the study of all Christian materials and reject the idea that only Watchtower publications are authoritative.</li>
        </ul>
